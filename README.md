# 10c_Final_Project
As a senior about to finish my college years, I decided to go out like any college student should, by coding a drinking game! The game
acts as a virtual board game. In an effort to protect the integrity of the student professor relationship, actual drinking challenges
are kept secretive (as challenge 1, challenge 2, etc), this will become more clear when you run the program. I have come to realize that 
creating a concept for a game can be much harder than actually coding it. Also, note that I had trouble getting git to work with my qt 
creator so the first commits are about halfway through the process. Here are the rules:

Welcome! To the world of M.A. Inwindow. You (and up to five others) have wound up on a island in another dimension and theres only one way 
off. You must show your worth by completing challenges on your own and with a friend before you can test yourself with the final challenge
to make it off the island.

Goal: complete a solo challenge, a duo challenge, and the final challenge.

Each turn: To start your turn, make sure the player who's turn it is has their box checked in the top right corner. Then hit take turn, 
and a random number between 1 and 12 will be generated in a hypothetical dice roll. You will get that many moves to begin your turn, but
you might need to take a sip of your drink first. Your goal is to make your way to a challenge area on the map (white for duo and black
for solo challenge). When you make it to a challenge, you will be prompted to generate a challenge for yourself. If you are able to 
complete this challenge, hit the completed challenge button and your score will be recorded. If you land on a duo challenge, pick your
favorite drinking buddy and try to take it on together. Each challenge space offers different types of challenges, so choose wisely!

Spirit of the game: Since it is a drinking game, people may find themselves not ready for their next turn. For this reason, anyone can 
take their turn at any time, or go in an order decided by the players. Once every player has completed both a solo and a duo challenge,
each player must make their way to the final destination where the final challenge awaits. Again, since some people might not be able to
make it to the end, the final challenge button can be clicked at any time. However, the goal is to get everyone to the final destination
with all challenges completed. Have fun, and drink responsibly!
