# 10c_Final_Project
As a senior about to finish my college years, I decided to go out like any college student should, by coding a drinking game! The game
acts as a virtual board game. In an effort to protect the integrity of the student professor relationship, actual drinking challenges
are kept secretive (as challenge 1, challenge 2, etc). 
Welcome! To the world of M.A. Inwindow.
